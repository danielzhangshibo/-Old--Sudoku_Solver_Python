This python program is to solve sudoku boards using a backtracking technique calls GAC Enforce. 
The program is implemented with two different ways to apply the gac-enforce, one is building Not-equal constraints with two elements in each constraint.(The model1) And the other way is building 1-9 contraints with nine elements in each constraint.(The model2)

The PDF is a runtime analyse report of the program. Notice the questions are in a seperate JPG image file.

If you want to run the program, please refer to the test_GacEnforce.py, which contains some code you can run. You can change the sudoku boards as well.
